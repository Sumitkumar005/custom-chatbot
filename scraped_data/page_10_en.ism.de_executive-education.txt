# Accessibility declaration

As the website operator, we (International School of Management (ISM)) endeavor to design the website in accordance with the relevant accessibility regulations. The following legal provisions apply to us:

- Law of the State of North Rhine-Westphalia on equal opportunities for people with disabilities (Behindertengleichstellungsgesetz Nordrhein-Westfalen - BGG NRW)
- Barrier-free Information Technology Ordinance North Rhine-Westphalia (BITVNRW)

## Website

This accessibility statement applies to the website [https://ism.de](https://ism.de/).

International School of Management (ISM)  
Otto-Hahn-Straße 19  
44227 Dortmund  
Tel.: 0231.97 51 39-0

Tel.: **0231.97 51 39-0**

## Status of compatibility with the requirements

This website is not fully compliant with the accessibility regulations that apply to us. In detail:

### Incompatibility with the legal provisions on accessibility

The content listed below does not comply with the relevant accessibility regulations:  
PDF files may be difficult to read. Likewise, not all videos, especially older ones, have subtitles or alternatives

### Disproportionate burden

The following content is not made available barrier-free because this would result in a disproportionate burden for us:

- Some pdf information cannot be displayed on the website in an alternative way within a reasonable framework.
- Older videos cannot be converted accordingly and would require a complete redesign at high cost.

### Exceptions to the scope of application of the accessibility regulations

The following non-accessible content on this website does not fall under the scope of the accessibility regulations:

- Archive of news articles
- Video recordings of study programs

### Accessible alternatives

We provide the following accessible alternatives for our non-accessible content:

- In addition to the directions, the postal addresses are also communicated
- There are alternatives for every communication channel, whether by post, telephone or digitally.

### Evaluation method

The website was self-evaluated using appropriate tools.

## Further measures to improve barrier-free access to our website

We are constantly striving to improve the accessibility of our website. We are currently doing the following:

In the future development of the website, the measures that have already been taken will be continuously considered further. This concerns not only the issue of color contrasts, but also the subtitles for videos or the integration of pdf documents.

## Enforcement procedure

If you believe that you have been disadvantaged by the inadequate accessibility of our website, you can contact the responsible enforcement body. You can reach them at:

Ombudsman's Office for Accessible Information Technology of the State of North Rhine-Westphalia at the State Commissioner for People with Disabilities
