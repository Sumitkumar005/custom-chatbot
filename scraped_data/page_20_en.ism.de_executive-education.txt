## Why study in Frankfurt am Main?

Mainhattan - as Frankfurt is also known because of its skyline dominated by skyscrapers - is known as an international hub, service center, banking city and for the annual book fair. The Hessian metropolis and fifth largest city in Germany is more international than other major German cities. It is precisely the **unique mix of finance, business, science and culture** that makes Frankfurt so exciting.

Apart from the many impressive skyscrapers in the banking district, Frankfurt also has a beautiful old town, green spaces and city oases. You can relax after lectures in the Palmengarten or visit one of the many museums on the Museumsufer, South of the Main. Cafés, restaurants and pubs invite you to enjoy the typical apple wine. A varied nightlife is also not missing in Frankfurt am Main.
