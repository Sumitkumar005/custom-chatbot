# Study International Management

### What is international management?

International management is the practice of leading businesses and organisations that operate in multiple countries or have cross-border operations. International management encompasses a wide range of functions, including **strategy, business administration, international marketing, finance, accounting, human resources, entrepreneurship and operations**, among others. The goal of international management is to create value for the organization while balancing the needs of various stakeholders across different countries.
