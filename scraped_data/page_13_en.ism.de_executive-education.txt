# Privacy Policy

## 1. OVERVIEW

The requirements of the **EU Data Protection Regulation** (hereinafter referred to as: GDPR) apply throughout Europe. Please read our privacy policy carefully.

The following data privacy information informs you about the nature and extent of the processing of so-called **personal data** by ISM International School of Management GmbH (hereinafter: ISM). Which data is processed in detail and how it is used depends largely on the services you have requested and have agreed upon. Therefore, not all parts of this data privacy information will apply to you. Personal data is information that can be directly or indirectly attributed to you.

Data processing by ISM can be divided into two main categories:

1. For the purpose of contract processing, all data required for the **execution of a contract** with ISM will be processed. If external service providers are also involved in the processing and execution of the contract, for instance transport companies, your data will be passed on to them to the extent necessary in each case.
2. When you access the ISM **website/application**, various information is exchanged between your end device and our server. This may also be personal data. The information collected in this way is used, among other things, to optimize our website or to display **advertising** in the browser of your end device.

In accordance with the provisions of GDPR, you have various rights which you can assert in relation to us. These include the right to raise an objection in relation to selected data processing, in particular data processing for advertising purposes. The option to object is available in print.

The ISM websites are hosted on external servers in Europe and are thus subject to applicable safety regulations applicable in Europe. The legal basis for this are the agreements on commissioned processing according to Article 28 of EU-GDPR.

If you have any questions about our data privacy policy, please feel free to contact us at [datenschutz@ism.de](mailto:datenschutz@ism.de).

You have a right to free information about your personal data stored by us and, if applicable, a right to correction, blocking or deletion of this data. If you have any questions about the collection, processing or use of your personal data, for information, correction, blocking or deletion of data and revocation of consents granted or objection to a particular use of data, please contact us directly: [datenschutz@ism.de](mailto:datenschutz@ism.de)

## 3. PURPOSE OF DATA COLLECTION, LEGAL BASIS, INTERESTS AND CATEGORY OF RECIPIENTS

### 3.1 Accessing our website/application

When you access our website/application, the browser used on your end device automatically sends information to the server of our website/application and temporarily stores it in a so-called log file. We have no influence on this. The following information is collected without your intervention and stored until automatic deletion after seven days:

1. IP address of the requesting Internet-enabled device,
2. Date and time of access,
3. Name and URL of the file retrieved,
4. Website/Application from which the access was made (referrer URL),
5. Browser used and, if applicable, the operating system of your Internet-enabled computer
6. Name of your access provider
7. Language, country, city
8. Screen resolution
9. Demographic characteristics: age, gender
10. Search keyword

The legal basis is Article 6 (1)(f) GDPR. Our legitimate interest follows from the purposes of data collection listed below. At this point, we would like to point out that we are not able to draw any conclusions about your identity from the collected data and that we will not do so.

The IP address of your terminal device and the other data listed above are used by us for the following purposes:

1. Ensuring smooth connection establishment,
2. Ensuring a comfortable use of our website/app,
3. Evaluating system security and stability as well as
4. Other administrative purposes

Furthermore, we use so-called cookies, tracking tools and targeting methods for our website/application. The exact procedures involved and how your data is used for this purpose is explained in more detail below in **section 3.3.4.**

If you have consented to so-called geolocation in your browser or in the operating system or other settings on your terminal device, we do not use this function. However, you may receive individual services based on your current location through the search engines you use or other online service providers.

### 3.2 Conclusion, execution or termination of a contract

#### 3.2.1 Data processing upon conclusion of a contract

The object of ISM's activities is the provision of services and the distance sale of goods, retail trade within the scope of the permits issued by the authorities and the serial production of the goods to be offered. In this context, we process the data required for the conclusion, execution or termination of a contract. This includes:

1. Last name / Birth name
2. First name
3. Place of birth
4. Country of birth
5. Date of birth
6. Gender
7. Nationality
8. Address(es)
9. Email address(es)
10. Entry date
11. Billing and payment information
12. Phone number(s)
13. Study program
14. Other courses booked (e.g. pre-courses)
15. Registration for exams
16. Exam results
17. Study contract
18. If available, further supplementary documents to the study contract

The legal basis for this is Article 6 (1)(b) GDPR. Insofar as we do not use your contact data for advertising purposes (see 3.3. below), we store the data collected for the processing of the contract until the expiry of the statutory or possible contractual warranty and guarantee rights. After expiration of this period, we retain the information of the contractual relationship required by commercial and tax law for the periods determined by law. For this period (regularly ten years from the conclusion of the contract), the data is processed again solely in the event of an audit by the tax authorities.

Furthermore, the above-mentioned data will be forwarded to foreign partner universities as part of your mandatory semester abroad.

#### 3.2.2 Identity, creditworthiness and transmission of data to credit agencies and debt collection companies

If necessary, we may verify your identity by using information from service providers. The legal basis for this is Article 6(1)(b) and (f) of GDPR. The authorization for this results from the protection of your identity and the prevention of fraud attempts at our expense. The circumstance and the result of our request will be added to your customer account or your guest account for the duration of the contractual relationship.

In the course of the ordering process, we also check your creditworthiness in order to be able to show you only the payment methods that can be used by you. For this purpose, we transmit the following types of data to so-called credit agencies cooperating with us: Name, address, date of birth. The legal basis for this is the following declaration of consent by you within the meaning of Article 6(1)(a) GDPR:

***I hereby consent to the verification of my creditworthiness by ISM. I am aware that the check is already carried out at the beginning of the order process and that I can revoke my consent at any time.***

You can **revoke your consent at any time** **with effect for the future** by sending a declaration to the address given under "Contact". The revocation of consent does not affect the lawfulness of the personal data processed until the revocation. If you do not want to give the above consent, please give us **before you** initiate **the completion of your purchase** a corresponding note or use **the option of guest ordering**. In this case, however, we can only offer you payment methods that are not associated with a credit risk for ISM. The circumstance and the result of our inquiry will be saved to your customer account for the duration of the contractual relationship.

If you have already made a purchase from us, the data we have stored about you may be supplemented by so-called score values. Scoring is the creation of a forecast of future events based on information collected and experience gained in the past. On the basis of the data stored about you, an assignment is made to statistical groups of people who have had similar entries in the past. The underlying method used is a well-founded mathematical-statistical method for forecasting risk probabilities that has been tried and tested in practice for a long time.

In the event of a delay in payment, we will transmit the necessary data to a company commissioned to enforce the claim if the other legal requirements are met. The legal bases for this are both Article 6(1)(b) and Article 6(1)(f) GDPR. The assertion of a contractual claim is to be regarded as a legitimate interest within the meaning of the second-named provision. We also transmit information about the delay in payment or a possible bad debt to credit agencies cooperating with us if the other legal requirements are met. The legal basis for this is Article 6(1)(f) GDPR. The legitimate interest which this requires arises from our and third parties’ interest in reducing contract risks for future contracts.

In order to collect our outstanding receivables, we transfer this function to a collection agency and, in this context, pass on the necessary data to the collection agency commissioned by us. This company first checks the legitimacy of the receivables transferred for collection and then sends a reminder for the delinquent invoice in writing or, if necessary, by telephone. If payment is refused, the collection agency will initiate legal dunning proceedings if necessary. There is also the possibility of execution as well as the seizure of realizable objects.

#### 3.2.3 Transmission of data to partner companies

ISM transmits the data collected during the application process for a study place (according to 3.2.1) as a curriculum vitae with attachments to qualified partner companies in order to support dual or part-time students in their search for a dual or partner in the run-up to their studies. The data will only be transmitted to partners exclusively for the application process. This data is deleted after completion of the application process or studies, unless longer legal retention periods exist.

### 3.3 Data processing for advertising purposes

#### 3.3.1 Advertising purposes of ISM and third parties

Insofar as you have concluded a contract with us, we manage you as an existing customer. In this case, we process your contact data in order to send you information about new and similar products and services. From time to time, we transmit your postal contact data to contract partners selected by us with special care as service providers, so that they can inform you about new and similar products of ISM.

#### 3.3.2 Advertising in line with interests

To ensure that you only receive information that is of supposed interest to you, we categorize and add further information to your customer profile. Statistical information as well as information about you (e.g. basic data of your customer profile) is used for this purpose. The aim is to send you advertising that is geared solely to your actual or perceived needs and, accordingly, not to bother you with useless advertising.

The legal basis for the aforementioned data processing is in each case Article 6(1)(f) GDPR. The processing of existing customer data in this way for our own advertising purposes or for the advertising purposes of third parties is to be regarded as legitimate interest.

#### 3.3.3 Right of objection

**You can object to data processing for the aforementioned purposes separately for the respective communication channel at any time and with effect for the future. For this purpose, it is sufficient to send an e-mail or a postal letter to the contact details mentioned under section 1.**

If you object, the contact address concerned will be blocked for further data processing for advertising purposes. We would like to point out that in exceptional cases, advertising material may still be sent after receipt of your objection. This is due to technical reasons and does not mean that we will not implement your objection. Thank you for your understanding.

## 5. VIDEO

### 5.1 Youtube

We use the provider YouTube to embed videos. The videos were embedded in the extended data protection mode. Like most websites, YouTube also uses cookies to collect information about visitors to its website. YouTube uses these, among other things, to collect video statistics, to prevent fraud and to improve the user experience. Also, this leads to a connection with the Google DoubleClick network. When you start the video, this could trigger further data processing operations. We have no control over this.

For more information about data protection at YouTube, please see their privacy policy at: <https://www.youtube.com/t/privacy_at_youtube>.

The legal basis for this is Article 6 (1)(f) GDPR.

### 5.2 Media library

If necessary, and if no other resource is available, film contributions are also integrated via media libraries; the legal basis for this is Article 6 (1)(f) GDPR. We would like to point out that other data protection guidelines and liability regulations apply to the use of third-party operators such as media libraries. The storage and use of data by the provider that is generated during use may exceed the scope of this privacy policy.

### 5.3 Zoom

We use Zoom web conferencing software to conduct classes, online meetings, video conferences, and/or webinars (hereinafter Online Meetings).

Zoom operator is:  
**Zoom Video Communications, Inc.**   
 **55 Almaden Blvd, Suite 600,**   
 **San Jose, California 95113, USA**

Insofar as you call up the Zoom website, the operator of Zoom is responsible for data processing. However, calling up the website is only necessary for using Zoom in order to download the software for using Zoom. You can also use Zoom if you enter the respective meeting ID and, if applicable, further access data for the meeting directly in the Zoom app. If you do not want to or cannot use the Zoom app, then the basic functions can also be used via a browser version, which you can also find on the Zoom website.

When using Zoom, different types of data are processed. **The scope of the data depends on the data you provide before or during participation in an online meeting.**

**The following personal data are subject to processing:**

- For **online meetings**: first name and surname, if applicable, subject of the meeting and description, attendee IP addresses and device/hardware information
- For **recording**: MP4 file of all video, audio and presentation recordings, M4A file of all audio recordings, text file of online meeting chat.
- When **dialing in with the telephone**: information on the incoming and outgoing phone number, country name, start and end time. If necessary, further connection data such as the IP address of the device can be stored.
- **Text, audio and video data**: You may have the option of using the chat, question or survey features in an online meeting. To this extent, the text entries you make are processed in order to display and, if necessary, log them in the "online meeting". In order to enable the display of video and the playback of audio, the data from the microphone of your terminal device and from any video camera of the terminal device will be processed accordingly for the duration of the meeting. You can turn off or mute the camera or microphone yourself at any time via the Zoom applications.

In order to participate in an online meeting or to enter the "meeting room", you must at least provide information about your name. If we want to record online meetings, we will transparently inform you in advance and - if necessary - ask for your consent. The fact of the recording will also be displayed to you in the Zoom app.

If it is necessary for the purposes of documenting or logging the results of an online meeting, we will log the chat content. However, this will usually not be the case. For purposes of recording and following up on online meetings, we may also process questions asked by webinar participants.

If you are registered as a user with Zoom, then online meetings reports (meeting metadata, phone dial-in data, webinar questions and answers in webinars, webinar survey function) can be **stored with Zoom for up to one month**.

The existing possibility of software-based "attention monitoring" ("attention tracking") is **deactivated**. Automated decision-making process within the meaning of Art. 22 GDPR is not used.

**Personal data that is processed in connection with participation in online meetings is generally not disclosed to third parties, unless it is intended for disclosure.** Please note that content from online meetings, as well as from face-to-face meetings, is often used to communicate information with customers, prospects or third parties and is therefore intended for disclosure.

Zoom's provider necessarily obtains knowledge of the above-mentioned data to the extent provided for in our order processing agreement with Zoom.

In order to give students the opportunity to view online courses at other times and time zones, they are **recorded on a voluntary basis, stored for one week and the deleted again**. For this purpose, the lecturer must activate the recording of his course himself.

Zoom is a service provided by a provider from the USA. **A processing of personal data therefore also takes place in a third country.** We have concluded an order processing contract with the Zoom provider.

The legal basis of the data processing is Article 6 (1)(b) and (f) GDPR. Information about data protection at Zoom can be found at: <https://zoom.us/docs/de-de/privacy-and-legal.html>

## 7. RECIPIENTS OUTSIDE THE EU

### 7.1 Data processing for advertising purposes

The processing mentioned in section 3.3 causes a data transfer to the servers of the providers of tracking and targeting technologies commissioned by us. These servers are located in the USA.

### 7.2 Data processing at foreign universities

In addition to the processing of data described in section 3.2, we will pass on your data to foreign universities located outside the European Union or the European Economic Area (EEA) if this involves the planning and implementation of a stay abroad in connection with your studies at ISM, which will be completed outside Europe.

## 8. YOUR RIGHTS

### 8.1 Overview

In addition to the right to revoke your consent given to us, you have the following additional rights if the respective legal requirements are met:

1. Right to information regarding your personal data stored by us according to Art. 15 GDPR,
2. Right to rectification of inaccurate data or completion of correct data according to Art. 16 GDPR,
3. Right to have your data stored by us deleted according to Art. 17 GDPR,

The above mentioned **general right to object** applies to all purposes for processing described in this Data Privacy Notice that are processed on the basis of Article 6 (1)(f) GDPR. Unlike the specific right of objection directed at data processing for advertising purposes (compare section 3.3.3 above), we are only obliged under the GDPR to implement such a general right of objection if you provide us with reasons of overriding importance for doing so (e.g. a possible risk to life or health). In addition, you have the option of contacting a supervisory authority or the data protection officer.

## 9. DATA SECURITY

All data transmitted by you personally, including your payment data, is transferred with the generally normal and secure standard SSL (Secure Socket Layer). SSL is a secure and proven standard, which is also used, for example, in online banking. Among other things, you can recognise a secure SSL connection by the attached s at the the http (for example https://…) in the address bar of your browser or by the lock symbol in the lower area of your browser.

We also use appropriate technical and organizational security measures to protect your personal data stored with us against manipulation, partial or complete loss and against unauthorized access by third parties. Our security measures are continuously improved in line with technological developments. Data exchange between the server and a computer accessing it (client) is secured by SSL certificates with the SHA-256 signature algorithm. This applies to ism.de und en.ism.de.
