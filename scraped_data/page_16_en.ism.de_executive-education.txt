#### Meet our Alumni

"Personally, the Master's in Luxury, Fashion and Sales Management at ISM helped me understand the luxury sectors of Kering, Richemont and LVMH much better. The practice-oriented lectures and case studies gave me unique insights into the working methods of these companies. Together with my semester abroad in Paris, this was the ideal springboard for my career in the luxury segment.

The knowledge of how luxury brands are managed helped me gain a foothold with LOREMO as a new, innovative art brand."

***Franziska Scheuerle**, ISM alumni, Master of Luxury, Fashion & Sales Management*

## Wow to apply for Master's in Germany?

**1. Fast Check of documents via Study Advisor**

International students who do not have the German first degree, need to send their **preliminary documents** to a study advisor for a **"fast check"** of their eligibility to study in Germany. Include:

- Curriculum vitae (CV)
- Bachelor's degree (if you have not graduated yet just the transcript of records)
- Certificate of English language, equivalent to the B2 level, for eg. TOEFL certificate, IELTS 6.0 or other (only needed if the medium of instruction in your university was not English).

**2. Admission Test Registration**

After clarifying your questions with the study advisor and if the fast check is successful, you can [register online for an admission test for master](/admission-test-registration). Then you will receive an link to the Application Portal where all the **application documents** can be submitted.

**3. Case Study Presentation**

You will have to prepare a case study presentation that you will also have to upload online before the second part of the admission process, the online interview. The case study presentation can include:

- presenting the main results of your Bachelor's thesis or
- of an extensive term paper you particularly liked or
- on a predefined case study topic that our study advisors will send you in advance.

The case study (presentation) that you prepared in advance builds the basis for the online interview with the respective program director of your desired study program.

**4. Online Interview**

Besides the classical interview, youâ€™ll hold and discuss the case study presentation and clarify any final questions. If everything fits, you will then receive a study place confirmation from the ISM. The decision on the allocation of a study place is usually made no later than one-two weeks after the interview test date.

#### **Application deadlines:**

We have no fixed applications deadline here at ISM, but we kindly ask international applicants **who require a visa for studying in Germany** to submit their application documents by

- **July 15th** for the programs starting in fall term.

#### When does a Master's in Germany start?

Students can start their studies in the ISM Master's programs in the fall term in September and in the non-consecutive degree program "International Business" in the spring term in March.

All Master study programs at ISM include a [semester abroad](/service/international-office) at one of our partner universities in Europe or overseas as well as 12 weeks of [compulsory internship](/service/career-center).

With the option **Fast Track** **option** the semester abroad is omitted and you can shorten the internship period. This allows you to complete your master's degree in **3 semesters** with **90 ECTS**. Certain prerequisites need to be fulfilled in order to benefit from this option. Find out everything you need to know from your [study advisor](/services/study-advisor).
