# Whistleblower Protection Act

The Whistleblower Protection Act (*Hinweisgeberschutzgesetz HinSchG*) came into force on **July 2, 2023**. The Whistleblower Protection Act obliges all institutions with more than 50 employees to set up an internal reporting system.  
  
**What does the Whistleblower Protection Act say?**

The Whistleblower Protection Act is intended to protect persons who have gained knowledge of breaches of statutory provisions or other binding regulations in the course of their professional activities and report them. Such whistleblowers must be able to disclose grievances without fear of reprisals.

The ESO Education Group and the ISM have decided to set up a reporting office **via third parties** to ensure confidentiality.

**Have you observed an incident that you would like to report? You can use the following link to submit your report confidentially:**  
[https://eso.wbportal.de](https://eso.wbportal.de/?lang=en "Report a person or incident")

You can report all violations committed by employees of our company in connection with their work.  
Violations can be any breach of the law or internal regulations.

We are committed to protecting whistleblowers. We do not tolerate any pressure or discrimination against whistleblowers. In return, the person concerned is presumed innocent as long as they have not been convicted of a violation.
